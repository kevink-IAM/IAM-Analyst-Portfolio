IAM Analyst Technical Portfolio: Proven ResultsOverviewThis portfolio documents three high-impact projects that demonstrate core technical proficiencies required of a modern Identity and Access Management (IAM) Analyst. The focus is on implementing secure, governed, and automated access solutions across major identity platforms.🛠️ Key Technologies UsedIdentity Providers (IdP): Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), OktaProtocols: SAML 2.0, Microsoft Graph APIAutomation: PowerShell ScriptingGovernance: Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), Audit LoggingProject 1: Entra ID GovernanceGoal: Clean up security vulnerabilities by removing direct administrative role assignments and implementing a standardized, group-based access model in Entra ID.Key OutcomeAnalyst Skill DemonstratedRole RemediationSuccessfully moved access control from individual users (violating PoLP) to a managed security group, preparing the environment for PIM (Privileged Identity Management).StandardizationApplied a clear, auditable naming convention and included ownership details in the group description for immediate compliance checks.Compliance ProofUsed Entra ID Audit Logs to confirm the successful de-provisioning (removal) of the original direct role assignments, completing the governance cleanup.Artifacts (Stored in the Entra ID Governance folder)Group Standardization Screenshot: Proof of compliant group naming and description.De-provisioning Audit Log: Audit trail confirming the role removal action.Project 2: Okta SSOGoal: Configure and validate a successful Single Sign-On (SSO) integration using SAML 2.0, connecting Okta as the Identity Provider (IdP) to a test Service Provider (SP).Key OutcomeAnalyst Skill DemonstratedFederation SetupConfigured the trust relationship by exchanging metadata, ensuring the IdP and SP could securely communicate.Attribute MappingPrecisely mapped required user claims and attributes within Okta to ensure the receiving application got the correct identity data.ValidationExecuted and captured the successful SAML assertion, confirming end-to-end user authentication was seamless.Artifacts (Stored in the Okta SSO folder)SAML Assertion Success Screenshot: Visual proof of the successful cross-platform authentication flow.Project 3: PowerShell AutomationGoal: Develop and execute a production-grade PowerShell script to automate a common security compliance task: auditing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) status for all users in Entra ID.Key OutcomeAnalyst Skill DemonstratedAPI ScriptingWrote a robust script that connects securely to the Microsoft Graph API using the minimum necessary scopes.Operational EfficiencyAutomated a task (MFA Audit) that would typically take hours via the GUI, transforming it into a single, executable script.Data DeliveryUsed PowerShell objects and export commands to deliver a clean, structured CSV report, ready for security team review.Artifacts (Stored in the PowerShell Automation folder)Check-MFAStatus.ps1: The fully commented, executable script code.
